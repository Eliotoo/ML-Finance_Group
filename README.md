## Format

* Select an interesting paper applying machine learning techniques to finance.

* Present a summary of the paper.

* Be sure to include necessary background.  It is preferable to spend time explaining things you think are obvious than to risk the audience not understanding your presentation

## Non-Exclusive List of Potential Topics
* Reinforcement learning for finance (investing, [hedging](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03042.pdf), order execution)
* Neural networks as interpolants (for [fast calibration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.09647.pdf) )
* Distribution learning with financial data (perhaps using [GANs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.06673.pdf), normalizing flows)
* Prediction ([high](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06917.pdf) and [low](http://dachxiu.chicagobooth.edu/download/ML.pdf) frequency )

## Why Applying Deep Learning to Finance is Hard

* Data is non-stationary and extremely limited (except in high-frequency applications).
* Interpretability is vital for persuading clients and regulators.
